# err-backend-slackv3
Slack Events and RTM backend for Errbot

## Purpose

This backend has been developed to support both the Slack Events and Real-time Message APIs.  It
uses the latest SDK from Slack.

The backend has been made available outside the core errbot project to allow development and user
feedback to happen on independent release cycles.

It is the hope and intention of the author that this backend will eventually be incorporated as part
of the official errbot project.
